## Style Guidelines:

- To evoke the required tone of professional seriousness, the primary color should be a sophisticated dark blue: #34495E. This color choice subtly reflects authority, intelligence, and trustworthiness, making users feel secure while using the app.
- The background color should be a very dark desaturated shade of blue to complement the primary dark blue tone while maintaining a modern and uncluttered aesthetic: #222F3A
- The accent color should be a brighter, attention-grabbing blue-green, placed approximately 30 degrees 'left' on the color wheel to add vibrancy, signal user interaction, and enhance key functions like scan initiation and viewing scan reports: #2ECC71.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, offers a clean and modern aesthetic suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Modern layout with a prominent 'Upload Image' button, scan history preview, and a clear display of scan results.
- Use professional, clear, and intuitive icons to represent different functionalities and scan results.
- Incorporate smooth animations for scanning progress, results display, and page transitions.
